# AUTOGames
AUTOGames is a program that aims to control all file/game downloads according to user-defined schedule.
AUTOGames' endgame is to be able to queue games across Steam, Epic Games, Origin etc. in whatever order needed.
For example: 2 games of 5 download first on Steam, only 1 game downloads on Origin, and then Steam continues.
This allows better downloading as games can download one at a time without relying on the launcher's own schedulers.
The audience intended is people with low bandwidth, which used to be me but no longer is.
